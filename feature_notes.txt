######Image combinations for testing:######
- gof or poa + hp4
- box2 + boxes
- eye + marilyn monroe  (m4 a7san 7aga bardo)
- linda + linda (100% match not really useful)


####Notes:#####
- number of correct matches a bit low. XXXXXX DONE
- add threshold slider in ui to control number of matches? XXXXXX DONE
- need to find a case to differentiate between ssd and ncc better.
- final images need to be RGB. XXXXXX DONE
- matching w/o cv2 functions takes too long so we can't use big images bc they generate too many keypoints (less than 100kb is good)!!!


- [NEW ISSUE]: el matches m4 btzbot lama bazabat el sorten 3ala 2 subplots, f keda bylza2o f ba3d f plot wada lama agy a match.

- so far i added el load (2 images) we connected all feature matching bits bl ui, fadel bas el computation time + wyt tabeetat fl 4akl wl thresholds
- ALL matching controls are LOCKED l7ad ma el butto bt3 APPLY SIFT clicked at least once.
- for switching between ssd and ncc, wait till matching is done, then it will take a few secs to recolect and apply
