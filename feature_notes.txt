######Image combinations for testing:######
- gof or poa + hp4
- box2 + boxes
- eye + marilyn monroe
- linda + linda (100% match not really useful)


####Notes:#####
- number of correct matches a bit low.
- add threshold slider in ui to control number of matches?
- need to find a case to differentiate between ssd and ncc better.
- final images need to be RGB. 
- matching w/o cv2 functions takes too long so we can't use big images bc they generate too many keypoints (less than 100kb is good)!!!
